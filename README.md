# üìù Note App

A command-line application built with Node.js that allows users to create, read, list, and remove notes.  
This project was developed by following along with [Andrew Mead's The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/).  

The app demonstrates foundational Node.js concepts such as the module system, working with the file system, parsing command-line arguments, and debugging.

## Features
- Add new notes with a title and body.
- List all saved notes.
- Read individual notes by title.
- Remove notes by title.
- Stores data locally in JSON format.
- Simple and intuitive CLI commands.

## Key Concepts Learned
This project was part of the following sections of the course:
1. **Node.js Module System** ‚Äì creating and exporting custom modules.  
2. **File System & Command Line Args** ‚Äì using Node‚Äôs `fs` module and parsing CLI arguments with `yargs`.  
3. **Debugging Node.js** ‚Äì using `console.log()` and Node.js built-in debugger for troubleshooting.  

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**  
- **Yargs** (for command-line argument parsing)  
- **Chalk** (for colored CLI output)  
- **File System (fs)**
